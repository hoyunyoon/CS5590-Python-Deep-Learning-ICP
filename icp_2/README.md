Write brief explanation here:
For problem 1, we have the user enter height data in inches and then we store that value into one dictionary and store a converted value in centimeters in another dictionary. The program will continue to ask if there is more data to enter, and once all data is entered, the program displays the contents of both dictionaries. In problem 2, the user enters a first and last name. These strings are sent to a full_name function to concatenate the two strings together and return the full name. The full name is sent to an string_alternative function where it returns a string that contains every other letter of the full name. Both function results are then displayed to the user. For problem 3, we open the given input file and an output file. We read through all the lines of the input file to add new words to a dictionary container and increase the word count of existing words. The word count information is then documented to the output file. Once all the information is logged, both the input and output files are closed

Write brief explanation here:
In problem 1, we created a class called Employee that took the employee's information to create the object and have methods to pay, fire, and check the employment status of the employee. Two subclasses, full time and part time, were made by inheriting from the Employee class and each subclass had their own version of a giveRaise method. In the main function, we had the program read the given input file and identify keywords to enable the program to execute the necessary action. Once the program read through the input file, the employee data was written to an output file and an average salary method was used to calculate the salary averages for the two types of employees. 
For problem 2, we needed to create a simple program that would parse the machine learning wiki page using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. After parsing the wiki page, we printed the title of the page, found and printed all the image links on the page using the 'img' tag, and returned the link for each of the images using the get method and 'src' tag.

Write brief explanation here:
We talk the main differences between Python 2 and Python 3 for the first problem.
In problem 2, we have the user fisrt enter a word and then we remove the last 2 characters and reverse the word to display to the user. 
We then ask the user to enter the integer values and perform some arithmetic operation with those values. Finally, we have the user enter a list of names and display how many names are preseent in the list, and a new name to the list, and print the new list of names.
for problem 3, we have the user enter a sentence and replace the word 'python' with 'pythons' after the word is replaced, the sentence is displayed back to the user.

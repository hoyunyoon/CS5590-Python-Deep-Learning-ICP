Write brief explanation here:
<br/> <br/> In the first task involving the numpy library, we created a vector of 15 numbers randomly generated from the range of 1 to 20 and shaped the vector into a 3 by 5 array. The shape of the array was printed out, the max values of each row were removed and replaced with a 0, and a diagonal was extracted, placed into another array, and saved as .npy files.
<br/> <br/> In the second task involving the pandas library, we read the given data.csv file into the program, showed the basic statistical description of the data, and checked for and replaced any NaN values in the data with the mean. We then aggregated the pulse and maxpulse columns with min, max, count, and mean. We also filtered the data frame to make sub data frames that contained rows with calories values between 500 and 1000 and rows with calories values greater than 500 and have a pulse value less than 100. A modified data frame was then created to hold all data except maxpulse and the maxpulse column was deleted from the original data frame. The datatype of the calories column was converted into int64, and a scatter plot was made using Duuration and calories columns of the data frame.
<br/> <br/> For the third task with the matplotlib library, we read the given image into the program, showed the image and its shape, and cropped the image to keep the word UMKC. The cropped image was saved as a new image file. Next, we changed to background of the image to black using the numpy where method, showed the changes, and converted the image type into uint8. The new image was then saved to a new image file.
